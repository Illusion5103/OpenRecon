# OpenRecon

OSINT bounty platform built with React, IPFS, Filecoin and on the Meter blockchain.

Built during the L2 Rollathon https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/Rollathon/?

## Motivation

### Equal Access to Intelligence

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is any information that can be legally gathered from public sources. It enables anyone with an internet connection to collect and analyze intelligence which can inform courses of action for businesses and people alike. Even for government-level intelligence work, the vast majority of information in a typical intelligence report is OSINT - it is estimated to be >80% since the Cold War ended (according to a book by Amy Zegart). 

Through OpenRecon, OSINT collection is financially rewarded, and everything is decentralized to escape censorship. This grants every person around the world - as well as orgs like businesses and governments - equal access to high quality intelligence.

### A Bounty Economy

We have seen successful bounty platforms for development and security work, but there are likely many other areas in which this model could be successfully applied. By building it on decentralized technologies, and using smart contracts to handle the financial transactions, the bounty model can incentivize and reward people in every country in disciplines like music, art, science, writing, and so on. 

On a technical level, OpenRecon is about building a system that uses IPFS/Filecoin in conjunction with a smart contract on an advanced Layer 2 solution (Meter) in order to store and monetize information in a completely decentralized mannner. The code is all open source and free to use by anyone - meaning anyone can modify OpenRecon to create their own bounty platform on these technologies, and foster a bounty economy in their own discipline of interest.
